        <h4>Collection and credit <br> scoring</h4>
        <p>Our company complies with united states laws, regulations and legal standards. If a particular situation arises during your repayment period, our collection department will work out a repayment agreement with you based on your situation. If the debtor defaults on any of the repayments under this agreement, the creditor may demand payment in full of any unpaid balance, principal, interest and costs. All judicial and extra-judicial costs that may reasonably be incurred by the creditor due to defects in a contract by the debtor will be claimed and returned to the creditor by the debtor. In the event that no payment agreement is possible between the debtor and the creditor, the creditor may assign the file to a collection agency, which may affect the debtor’s credit rating or credit score. This information is provided as an example and takes into account the brokerage fees added to the principal amount borrowed. Renewing your loan is not automatic, you must request it. There is a $50 service charge for insufficient funds. In the event of non-payment, <b>a collection agency will call or text you.</b> There is a service charge if your loan is accepted.</p>
